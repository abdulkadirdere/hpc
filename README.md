High Performance Computing

In this project we look at different aspects of high performance computing.

1. Parallelising KNN's distance and sorting functions.
  - Distance functions: Manhattand and Euclidean distances are used to calculate the k-nearest neighbours of a given point.
  - Sorting algorihtms: Quick sort and merge sort are the main sorting algorithms used to sort the calculated distance matrix to identify nearest neighbours for each given query point. Bubble sort, insertion sort and selection sort are also included to assess their performance in parallel version of KNN, if it is possible.
